Please adhere to PEP 8 for all code suggestions. Use descriptive variable names, avoid single-letter variables, and ensure code is readable and maintainable. 

Be sure that whenever applicable, all functionality should be exposed through the web app, the rest api and the admin interface.

When writing functions, include type hints and docstrings to explain the purpose and usage of the function.

Always handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

When suggesting code, ensure it is relevant to the context provided and avoid unnecessary complexity.

If a solution requires multiple steps, break it down into smaller, manageable parts.

Please always write tests for any new functionality or changes to existing code.

Use a consistent testing framework and ensure that tests cover both normal and edge cases.

If you are suggesting changes to existing code, ensure that the changes are backward compatible unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Provide clear explanations for any modifications and the reasoning behind them.

Please always ensure that the documentation is clear, concise and always up to date.

Use comments to explain complex logic or important decisions in the code, but avoid redundant comments that simply restate what the code does.

When suggesting libraries or frameworks, ensure they are well-maintained and widely used in the community.

Provide links to documentation or resources where appropriate.

When providing examples, ensure they are relevant and demonstrate best practices.

Avoid using deprecated or outdated methods unless necessary for the context.

Finally, always review your suggestions for clarity, correctness, and adherence to the guidelines before submitting them.

Aim for high-quality, maintainable code that follows industry standards.
